made synth data
figuring out how to calculate the different decompositions
first experiment is to train a model and track the decompositions through training
second experiment will be to do some active learning stuff
building out the decomposition calculation code
code runs. decompositions look reasonable
next step is getting tensorboard working, and logging also, to track the step by step progression of these things
when running model, looks like value is almost optimal, but L_do is way worse than L ... why? Bug?
maybe the imbalance is related? I generated some pretty imbalanced data
as the dataset becomes less imbalanced, treatment shift gets smaller. matches more closely to the values of V
