tensorflow set up
calculating differences in V values in decompositions.py
interesting - breaking down by databias then by function loss shows how the loss incurred by data sampling starts increasing partway through training, loss incurred by function learning keeps decreasing
splitting out metrics by value of A; only printing to file, not to screen or TB. should I be logging everything somewhere?
logging train+valid metrics now
