new synth data
when I run with 3 units in model, I underfit on offset data; this yields high discrim. in the function learning regret, but none in the dataset bias regret
5 units fixes it; lower overall loss, and lower discrim everywhere, esp in fnlearn
3 or 5 units doesnt make a difference on synth_basic
