okay, in corrAZ we are finally getting non-zero data bias terms. progress!
why are we getting higher values than the bayes optimal? look into this
reminder: independently optimally estimating each outcome and then taking the max is not the way to get a Bayes optimal treatment
bayes optimal treatments are being calculated correctly now
